As probably gathered, my name is George and I am a Computer Science graduate from Youngstown State University. I decided to make this page to act somewhat as a collection of projects I have done and will do in the future. It was also a good "project" itself to learn new tools and languages. I am interested in persuing a career within a data driven field, whether that is data analysis, engineering, or training AI. 

Experience 
======
Currently, I have no professional experience within the fields I mentioned above. However, I take pride in being flexible and malleable. By this I mean, ability to learn on the fly and be adaptable for the ever changing landscape. If there is something that I am unsure of or do not understand I am confident in my abilities to ask the right questions and use external resources to achieve what is being asked of me. The jobs I have worked previously may not have required coding skills but they do involve a lot of people skills and teamwork, something that I know is valued in every industry.

Hobbies
======
Not too sure how interesting a hobby section is these days but I'll keep it brief while also giving a pretty good insight into who I am as a person. I'm a nerd. Besides the usual, enjoy taking the dog for walks, hanging out with friends and family, I am a passionate consumer of games. I'd like to say I enjoy MMOs the most, I kinda missed out on the WoW wave and we all know how that genre has looked since. Currently I try anything competitive, Valorant in specific (peaked Immortal 1), I have to brag a little on my own site right? I also used to attend various East Coast, U.S. LANs for Call of Duty with some decent placements. 

**TL;DR** 
Big nerd who min-maxes games for fun.
