As probably gathered, my name is George and I am a Computer Science graduate from Youngstown State University. I decided to make this page to act somewhat as a collection of projects I have done and will do in the future. It was also a good "project" itself to learn new tools and languages. I am interested in persuing a career within a data driven field, whether that is data analysis, engineering, or training AI.
