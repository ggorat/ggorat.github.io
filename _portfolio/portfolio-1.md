This capstone project was a good comprehensive overview of all the subject matter taught throughout this certificate. I started off using MySQL Workbench to create a server. From there I created a new model for the project that was in accordance with 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. Using the forward engineering feature, the schema was created.<br/>

From there I populated the tables with a slightly altered dataset given in an earlier course of this program. Once the data was in, I began creating prepared statements and stored procedures to help the "company" retrieve the necessary data.<br/>

Finally, using Jupyter noteboook I connected the database with Python using the MySQL/Python connector for a couple of use cases. To be honest this was actually gone over in way more depth in another project that I did. After doing this, the data was uploaded to Tableau to create a few worksheets and dashboard. This was using a different dataset, I assume just so that it was more complete.<br/>
