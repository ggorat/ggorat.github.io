This post will follow my thought process and learnings while creating a neural network and then running the MNIST data set through it. A few quick disclaimers: <br/>
1. The data set used is publicly available on Kaggle.com. <br/>
2. I decided to start this project after seeing a video on YouTube by creator, Samson Zhang. Link to video [here].(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&list=LL&index=17&t=580s)<br/>
3. This is my first project centered around AI, and although I have a CS degree a lot of the extensions and features I used throughout this project I had little to no experience with such as Git, crazy I know but never needed it for class ðŸ« , matplotlib, numpy, or pandas.<br/>
4. All necessary files will be available on my [GitHub]().<br/>
