title: "Database Modeling and Analysis"
excerpt: "For this I am combining two projects into one. The following projects involved setting up a database client and using it to create stored procedures and prepared statements. The other focuses on the utilization of design and using different models to build database schemas."

In the database clients project, I first created a database to the specifications given. Then using Python I created a connection pool so users could connect into the system. Once that was done, I scripted stored procedures in order to query relevant data for the business. Throughout this project I used try and error blocks to catch said errors, one specifically being too many users trying to connect to the pool at once, in which case a new connection was then established. [This](https://github.com/ggorat/little_lemon_db.git) link will take you to my GitHub where all the code is stored. And [this](https://coursera.org/share/29d7cf055df761a426bf2ff6ebf15a65) link will take you to the verification of my Database Clients certificate.<br/>

The second project involved the modeling of a database, this is unrelated to the previous project. I created an ER diagram in SQL Workbench as well as a star diagram using drawio. In Workbench, I forward engineered the schema and set up the database. Using given data, I then uploaded the data into Tableau to create a few worksheets and interactive dashboard.
